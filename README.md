This Class sends a chosen SMS message to a list of numbers. I chose to create it because I was tasked with sending a good morning message to up to 20 numbers every morning as part of my pledge process to join a fraternity. 
Unfortunately, while learning how to work with Twilio and send SMS messages, I discovered that a legal entity or business is required for toll-free verification of a phone number on Twilio. 
Due to this, I decided to abandon my idea and send messages manually.
